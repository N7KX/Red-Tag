# RFID CARD
 Security problems are being overlooked in a students life on a daily basis. We propose an RFID Database Application that keeps track of Student Attendance, Student Location at all times on campus and additional features include payment and communication. This system helps with time saving, easy control and reliability. Very easy to handle and convenient to use for any campus.

 Some of the languages we used for our project are: Python, HTML, CSS, Java and MySQL.
 Our project is based on providing a few features in order to enhance ED-TECH. 
The features are as follows:
- Class attendance taken through RFIDs to reduce the load on professors/teachers.
- Payments made possible through the RFID
- In case the card is lost, a special password which gives access to location tracking even when off-campus.
- RFID scan when entering the campus. Starts the location Tracking while on campus.
- Special RFID Readers inside Specially Abled Washrooms. This can help to switch on and off the lights.
- Borrowing and Returning Books to the Library. A message sent to student in case of delay in returning
- Examination Attendance directly through the RFID Cards
